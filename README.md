## Introduction

The transnational data has been collected from 2009-12-01 to 2011-12-09 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The 1044848 records of customer ID, price, quantity, invoice date, description, and country are included in the data set. The manager is interested in targeting customers for developing business development strategies. This project will use various features, e.g., Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM), for customer segmentation and explore the difference among customer groups.
